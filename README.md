## Testing

1. Backend testing
To run the backend tests navigate to the backend folder in your CL and run "setup-mock-db" to set up the test database. You can then run "npx jest --coverage" to see the coverage

2. Frontend testing
To run the frontend tests navigate to the client folder in your CL and run "npm run coverage" to see the coverage

If you do not have the dependencies installed run "npm install" in both the client and backend folders
